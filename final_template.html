			<h2>THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TAKES A DEATHLY TOLL ON THE ELDERLY COMMUNITY IN TEXAS</h2>

			<h3>The deaths of people within the 70+ age group makes up more than half of all Covid-19 fatalities in Texas</h3>
			
			<p>Since the pandemic's start in March 2020, Covid-19 deaths have adversely affected elderly populations. Older individuals are more affected by Covid-19 contraction counts, severe illness, hospitalizations, and death tolls than any other age group. </p>
			<p>In looking at Texas, a state that was hard hit throughout the multiple different variant waves, elderly individuals 70+ make up more than half of the total Covid-19 related deaths in the state. Data from the Texas government shows that the 70+ age group accounts for 53.7% of all Covid-19 deaths in Texas. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Although older age groups are more vulnerable and at risk of severe illness, the starkest divide in death tolls between age groups is between individuals in their 60s and 70s. According to a STAT article, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/30/what-explains-coronavirus-lethality-for-elderly/"> 4%</a> of hospitalized individuals in their 60s who have contracted Covid-19 will die; however, hospitalized individuals in their 70s have an 8.6% of dying. The drastic jump of over double the likelihood of dying from Covid-19 in a span of ten years is a cause for concern. </p>
			<p>Studies have tried to make sense of the heightened threat of death for those 70+ and found that many 70+ individuals have chronic underlying conditions which significantly weaken their immune systems' ability to combat the virus. </p>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/aging/covid19/covid19-older-adults.html"> CDC</a>openly states that older populations infected with Covid-19 are more likely to be hospitalized and die. Furthermore, they urge elderly individuals to get vaccinated and take preventive measures in order to protect themselves as much as possible. </p>
			<p>Margaret Ruffen, an I.C.U. scribe at Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, worked with many elderly patients infected with Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic.</p>

			<p>“The overwhelming majority of Covid patients I’ve seen have been older people in their mid-seventies or older, and it’s really sad to see,” said Ruffen.</p>
			<p>	Out of the 84774 individuals who have died thus far in Texas from Covid-19, 45532 individuals fell within the 70+ age group. </p>
			<p>“In the beginning, we were seeing lots of older patients super sick with Covid-19, and at the time, we were using ventilators. We stopped using ventilators because, quite frankly, they were doing way more harm than good, and lots of people who got on them never got off. But now that the pandemic has definitely slowed a bit, we are seeing the most deaths among older people who aren’t vaxxed,” said Ruffen.</p>
			<p>According to <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-percentage-of-covid-19-vaccines-administered.html ">Becker’s Hospital Review,</a> Texas is ranked 41st for U.S. states’ percentage of Covid-19 vaccines administered, with only 61.6% of its population. Texas Governor Greg Abbott created the <a href="https://abc13.com/texas-gov-greg-abbott-announcing-save-our-senior-program-sos-to-vaccinate-elderly-people-efforts-citizens-homebound-seniors/10447987/ ">“Save Our Seniors”</a> initiative to expand eligibility to senior Texans for easily accessible vaccines in rural parts of the state. However, this initiative was not nearly as successful as Abbott had hoped because it was nearly impossible to provide extensive support and care to extremely isolated yet vulnerable populations.</p>
			<p>“There have been many times when older patients who are really ill and aren’t vaxxed don’t seem to understand how much the vaccine could have helped prevent just how severe their symptoms would be until it’s too late,” said Ruffen.</p>

			<p>There is a robust conservative following in Texas of anti-vaxxers. The most significant percentages of anti-vaxxers are in rural regions which overwhelmingly voted for <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/03/unvaccinated-texas-demographics/ ">Donald Trump</a> in 2020. Many anti-vaxxers in Texas chose to abstain from the vaccine jab due to political distrust or religious disapproval.</p>
			<p>Receiving all dosages of the Covid-19 vaccination adds a protective layer against the virus and drastically reduces severe side effects and hospitalization. Individuals who are unvaccinated are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/09/texas-unvaccinated-deaths-higher-covid/ ">forty-five </a> more times likely to catch Covid-19, and individuals who are fully vaccinated are forty times less likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are not vaccinated or partially vaccinated. </p>
			<p>“I would strongly, strongly encourage even those who have not already been vaccinated or need to get a booster to do so. They really save lives and keep the community safe,” said Ruffen.</p>

			<p>	Although the Covid-19 vaccines reduce hospitalization rates and help significantly decrease the spread of infection, which was initially rampant, elders' weaker immune systems are more susceptible to enduring severe and potentially deadly symptoms, which ultimately results in a higher rate of fatalities among this age group.</p>
			<p>Over the past two years, the Covid-19 pandemic has altered, disrupted, and senselessly taken the lives of millions of people. The deaths of loved ones have surpassed any imaginable number and have left many people unable to cope with the enormous toll on humanity. However, during this trying time, as the world begins to resume normalcy, it is imperative that others take into consideration continuing to implement Covid-19 safety measures in their lives to ensure the utmost protection for older age groups and compromised individuals who are more susceptible to getting severely ill or dying from Covid-19.</p>
